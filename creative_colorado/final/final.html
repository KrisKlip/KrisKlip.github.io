					<h3>The Mouse</h3>
					<p class = "sectionTxt">In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.</p>  <p class = "sectionTxt">Physically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons.</p>

					<h3>Graphic User Interface</h3>
					<p class = "sectionTxt">In computing, a graphical user interface is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.</p>

					<h3>Hypertext</h3>
					<p class = "sectionTxt">Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references to other text which the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail. The hypertext pages are interconnected by hyperlinks, typically activated by a mouse click, keypress sequence or by touching the screen. Hypertext is the underlying concept defining the structure of the World Wide Web.</p>
