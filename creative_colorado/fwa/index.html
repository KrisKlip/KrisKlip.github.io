	<p>I viewed adn will review the VOID site on the FWA site. VOID was a website  that was selected for Site of the day for July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2015. In my opinion this is the most interesting site I have ever been to. It is entirely interactive and unlike anything I have ever seen. On most sites I can visualize what type of code goes into creating it and usually I have at least a slight idea in how I would go about duplicating it. For VOID I am completely clueless on how the site was made and where I would start if I was to try to create something similar. I found it fascinating on how the site was created as a visual graphics and art demo rather than to present content about something. The graphics and animation were amazing. Every page was gripping and visually stimulating. I was blown away by the art and how everything that was happening was within a browser. I would love to create a page that could do something similar but I don't even know where I would start in creating it. I don't even know what language I would use to create it. I imagine much could be created through javascript but there were also a lot of features that I imagine couldn't be duplicated using javascript. I also thought the art and the audio were very well done. They worked together well and each significantly added to the artistic themes being presented. I also really loved the 3 dimensional presentation, it drew me deep into the art. Overall, it was a very intriguing site and I wish I knew what all was happening under the hood in order to make it work.</p>
