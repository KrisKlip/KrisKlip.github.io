    <h1>Technology Arts and Media in Academics</h1>
    <p>Currently I am a TAM Major, so rather than talking about all of the uses of Technology, Arts, and Media in the world, I  want to talk about how the internet is being used for new purposes in education by all ages of students around the world.</p>
    <p>Education has drastically changed in the last few years and thanks to the internet it has become more available to a larger audiences. We are in an educational revolution and I think it is a very interesting subject to focus on. The first thing I want to talk about is the internet and its uses in the academic world.</p>
