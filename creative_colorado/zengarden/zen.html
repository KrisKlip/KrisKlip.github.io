					Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances,
					c
					omputers have been made a mystery to most of the world.
					And this situation does not seem to be improving. You hear
					more and more about computers, but to most people it’s just
					one big blur. The people who 
					know
					a
					bout computers often
					seem unwilling to explain things or answer your questions.
					St
					ereotyped notions develop about computers operating in
					fi
					x
					ed ways—and so confusion increases. The chasm between
					la
					y
					men and computer people widens fast and dangerously.</p>

					Anything with buttons or lights can be palmed off on the

					men as a computer. There are so many different things,
					and their differences are so important; yet to the lay public
					they are lumped together as “computer stuff,” indistinct and
					beyond understanding or criticism. It’s as if people couldn’t
					t
					ell apart camera from exposure meter or tripod, or car from

					premise that </p>

				<h2>EVERYBODY SHOULD 
				UNDERSTAND COMPUTERS.</h2>
				<div class = "section">
					<p class="animated3 pulse">It
					is intended to fill a crying need. Lots of everyday people
					have asked me where they can learn about computers, and I
					have had to say 
					nowh
					ere.
					Most of what is written about
					c
					omputers for the layman is either unreadable or silly. (Some
					ex
					ce
					ptions are listed nearby [on pp. 6–7 of the first edition,
					not reprinted here]; you can go to them instead of this if you
					w
					ant.) But virtually nowhere is the big picture simply enough
					ex
					plained. Nowhere can one get a simple, soup-to-nuts
					ov
					erview of what computers are really about, without
					t
					echnical or mathematical mumbo-jumbo, complicated
					ex
					amples, or talking down. This book is an attempt.</p>
					<p class="animated1 pulse">(And nowhere have I seen a simple book explaining to the
					la
					ym
					an the fabulous wonderland of computer graphics
					which awaits us all, a matter which means a great deal to me
					personally, as well as a lot to all of us in general. That’s
					discussed on the f lip side.)</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "section">
					<p class="animated4 pulse">Computers are simply a necessary and enjoyable part of
					life, like food and books. Computers are not everything, they
					are just an 
					a
					spect
					of everything, and not to know this is
					c
					omputer illiteracy, a silly and dangerous ignorance.</p>

					<p class="animated2 pulse">Computers are as easy to understand as cameras. I have
					tried to make this book like a photography magazine—
					breezy, forceful and as vivid as possible. This book will
					ex
					plain how to tell apples from oranges and which way is up.
					If
					y
					ou want to make cider, or help get things right side up,
					y
					ou will have to go on from here.</p>

					<p class="animated1 pulse">I am not a skillful programmer, hands-on person or
					eminent professional; I am just a computer fan, computer
					fa
					na
					t
					ic if you will. But if Dr. David Reuben can write about
					sex I can certainly write about computers. I have written this
					like a letter to a nephew, chatty and personal. This is perhaps
					less boring for the reader, and certainly less boring for the
					wr
					it
					er, who is doing this in a hurry. Like a photography
					magazine, it throws at you some rudiments in a merry
					setting. Other things are thrown in so you’ll get the sound of
					them, even if the details are elusive. (We learn most everyday
					things by beginning with vague impressions, but somehow
					encouraging these is us not usually felt to be respectable.)</p>

				<div class = "section">
					<p class="animated3 pulse">Wh
					at
					I have chosen for inclusion here has been arbitrary,
					based on what might amuse and give quick insight. Any
					bright highschool kid, or anyone else who can stumble
					through the details of a photography magazine, should be
					ab
					le to understand this book, or get the main ideas. This will
					not make you a programmer or a computer person, though it
					may help you talk that talk, and perhaps make you feel more
					c
					omfortable (or at least able to cope) when new machines
					encroach on your life. If you can get a chance to learn
					programming it’s an awfully good experience for anybody
					ab
					ov
					e fourth grade. But the main idea of this book is to help
					y
					ou tell apples from oranges, and which way is up. I hope you
					do go on from here, and have made a few suggestions.</p>

					<p  class="animated4 pulse">I am “publishing” this book myself, in this first draft form,

					c
					omputers, among all you Folks Out There, as I think. I will
					be interested to receive corrections and suggestions for
					subsequent editions, if any. (The computer field is its own
					ex
