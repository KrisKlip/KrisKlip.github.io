	<p class = "one">For my website I want to create something creative and unique. I want it to have a significant amount of animation and possibly interactivity. I was thinking of trying to create a parallax scrolling site because I have always wanted to know how to make them. I want to include a little personal overview of who I am, a list of both personal and work projects I have done over the years, a page of hobbys and interests, and finally a contact page with links to my LinkedIn profile and other methods of contact. As far as Styling goes I want it to be fairly dark with color highlights. I was thinking black, white, grey, and orange.
